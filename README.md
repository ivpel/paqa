# PAQA 
#### (Python Automation QA)
The idea of this project is to collect lists of questions and answers on topics that a test automation engineer needs to
know using the Python language.

This is not step-by-step guide, this is more kind of cheat sheet. Use it to refresh your knowledge before
interview or just in any case when you need it.
